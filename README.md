# Module 9 Challenge (SQL challenge)
## Problem
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

  * *Query script*: [EmployeeSQL/Sql_Script/query_script.sql](https://github.com/pallavitripathi3107/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/Sql_Script/query_script.sql)

  * *ERD code*: [EmployeeSQL/ERD/QuickDBD_script](https://github.com/pallavitripathi3107/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/ERD/QuickDBD_script)
 
*Note:* CSV files not included because of the size of the files.

## Learnings
* Learned to create Entity Relationship diagrams post understanding the data provided.
* Learned how to use tools like QuickDBD to create *Entity Relationship Diagram* (ERD).
* Learned to use ERD to create tables and constraints.
* Learned to use CSV files to populate the data in the tables.
* Learned to write queries on the created tables.
* Learned to use p4Admin IDE to write SQL scripts.
